Files are divided into chunks, which are typically 64 megabytes in size.
Chunks are replicated, perhaps three times, at three different compute nodes.
Moreover, the nodes holding copies of one chunk should be located on different
racks, so we donâ€™t lose all copies due to a rack failure. Normally, both the chunk
size and the degree of replication can be decided by the user.
To find the chunks of a file, there is another small file called the master node
or name node for that file. The master node is itself replicated, and a directory
for the file system as a whole knows where to find its copies. The directory itself
can be replicated, and all participants using the DFS know where the directory
copies are.
